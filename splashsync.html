                    on creating clear, intuitive displays and
                    promoting safety habits, enabling users to make informed decisions while out on the water.</p>
                <h2>Competetive Research</h2>
                <p>To make the app more competitive in the market I had to first see what was out there and how could
                    fill the gaps. I did this by using the SWOT method.</p>
                <h3>Lazy Surfer</h3>
                <h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>An individualized experience, the user can rate their session, so the preferences are geared
                        towards
                        the specific user rather than a general preference setting
                    <li>It has an add friend feature so you can check out their sessions as well</li>
                    <li>Its fairly priced at 49.99/ year </li>
                    <li>The developers are actively taking suggestions from user reviews</li>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigation is a little confusing, once you open drop down navigation bar there are 4 icons
                        at the top but its not clear what they are supposed to be until clicking on them</li>
                    <li>The tips and tricks takes you to a Youtube page instead of just having within the app</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><b>Opportunities</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Better defined navigation menu would set my product apart</li>
                    <li>Having access to purchase or rent surfing gear would also set my app apart.</li>
                    <li>Having safety tips readily available</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><b>Threats</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Because its a newer app, apps like Surfline that have been around for awhile
                        they have a wider following and with each new update could potentially surpass Lazy Surfer </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Surfline</h3>
                <h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forecasts are solid and are available as soon as you open the app</li>
                    <li>Has a surf shop you can buy surfing gear from which is convenient</li>
                    <li>Has a news feature which could come in handy for surfing outcasts and temperature forecasts</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The homepage is not aesthetically pleasing like other surfing forecast apps that I’ve seen
                    <li>It’s a little pricey compared to other apps offering the same thing (99.99/year)</li>
                    <li>It doesn’t have a social feature like adding a friend or a chats</li>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4><b>Opportunities</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding in a social component like a chat area or and add friend feature </li>
                    <li>Having a more up to date design overall but specially with the homepage </li>
                    <li>Having safety tip readily available</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><b>Threats</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Because the website has been around since 1985, the app is a step in the right direction but
                        staying stuck in older design patterns could be an issue. I noticed this may be the case with
                        the homepage as it seems a little rudimentary in design.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>User Interviews</h2>
                <p>Now that I knew what the app was up against, I wanted to start interviewing users that use similar
                    apps to get a deeper
                    understanding of their needs and frustrations. I did this by interviewing six participants and
                    asking them 16 questions through moderated remote testing</p>
                <h3>Research Goal</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Have a better understanding of what types of information users tend to prioritize
                        for decision making in their water sport activities</li>
                    <li>What are user’s perceptions of the trustworthiness and reliability of weather data
                        that is currently available and how can improve upon that</li>
                    <li>Understand how users interpret and apply weather data to plan for their water-based
                        activities and identify any challenges users face in understanding meteorological information.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The user interviews revealed key insights into the specific weather information crucial for water
                    sports enthusiasts.
                    For surfers, the focus lies on wave height, wind speed, and swell direction, with wave conditions
                    taking precedence in decision-making.
                    Paddleboarders prioritize wind speed for ease of paddling and wave conditions for stability, while
                    boaters prioritize wind speed and direction
                    for navigation safety, with wave conditions playing a secondary role
                    All users emphasize the importance of clear visuals and user-friendly interfaces in interpreting
                    weather data. They commonly cross-check forecasts
                    from reliable sources and value historical accuracy for building trust in weather apps, with
                    specialized marine-focused platforms deemed more
                    trustworthy than general weather apps.</p>
                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <h2>Ava Reynolds</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age:28</li>
                    <li>Web Chat Interview</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What kind of water sport do you partake in and what would you say is your experience
                        level?</strong></p>
                <p>"I like to surf, and I’ve been surfing for about 5 years now"</p>
                <p><strong>What specific weather information is most important for your water sports
                        activities?</strong></p>
                <p>"The most critical weather information for my surfing activities includes wave height, wind speed,
                    and swell direction. These factors significantly
                    impact the quality and rideability of the waves, influencing my overall surfing experience."</p>
                <p><strong>Are there specific sources or providers that you consider more trustworthy than
                        others?</strong></p>
                <p>"Surf-specific platforms and services dedicated to water sports tend to be more accurate and reliable
                    than general weather apps."</p>
                <p><strong>What features or assurances would make you more confident in the accuracy of the weather data
                        provided by a maritime weather app?</strong></p>
                <p>"Clear explanations of meteorological concepts, real-time updates, and a track record of accurate
                    predictions would significantly boost my confidence in a maritime weather app."</p>
                <h2>User Personas</h2>
                <p>Based on the user interviews I developed user personas, like Alex and Emma, to deeply understand the
                    unique goals and challenges of water sports enthusiasts,
                    ensuring the app addresses real user needs such as safety, clarity, and convenience.</p>

                <h2>User Flows</h2>
                <p>Using these personas, I mapped user flows to identify key touchpoints, streamlining tasks like
                    checking real-time conditions and navigating user profiles.
                    This approach enabled the design of intuitive, visually clear experiences that reduce stress,
                    promote informed decision-making, and make Splashsync an indispensable tool for users.</p>

                <h2>Usability Testing and Iterations</h2>
                <p>Through user testing and usability testing I learned that maritime professionals needed real-time,
                    accurate weather updates tailored to their needs. They also sought a highly customizable,
                    user-friendly app
                    to quickly access vital information in high-pressure situations. These insights guided my design,
                    focusing on clarity and efficiency. I tested 6 participants using an unmoderated remote testing
                    method.</p>

                <h2>The Challenges</h2>
                <h3>Balancing Industry Knowledge</h3>
                <p>Due to the target audience being experts, beginners and everything in between I found balancing the
                    knowledge of the users to be a challenge to meet in the app.
                    How do I make the experts feel engaged while making sure the beginners aren’t overwhelmed with new
                    jargon and while also ensuring everyone else in the middle doesn’t feel left out?</p>

                <h3>Living in a Land Locked State</h3>
                <p>I currently reside in a landlocked state, and while I personally enjoy paddleboarding on Indiana’s
                    lakes most of this research took place in the off seasons.
                    This made for some challenging research. Ideally, I would have liked to be out on the water
                    interviewing face to face while the users are in their element</p>

                <h2>The Lessons</h2>
                <p>This was my first UX case study and while I learned a lot one of the major takeaways is that
                    sometimes simple is better.
                    I was worried about balancing the app, so experts don’t feel disengaged, and beginners aren’t
                    overwhelmed, but through my research I found that a lot of experts were also feeling overwhelmed
                    with complex weather jargon.
                    The solution was a lot less complicated than I was trying to make it. I went with a simple layout,
                    kept the wording easy to read and to the point, and added in a glossary for extra measure.
                    I also learned that for research, location and timing do make a difference. It’s not to say that
                    creating an app like this in a land locked state shouldn’t be done, but you do have to get creative
                    with not only how you choose your participants but the questions you are asking.
                    All in all, these challenges helped me grow as a designer and I look forward to continuing this
                    journey with SplashSync.</p>
