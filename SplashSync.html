            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>SplashSync is a responsive web app that simplifies real-time wind, wave, and weather reports for sailors, surfers, and divers. 
                </p><p>Designed for safety and ease, it transforms complex data into clear, visual insights, helping users make informed decisions.
                    </p><p>With personalized onboarding, intuitive navigation, and safety recommendations, SplashSync ensures water sports enthusiasts
                    </p><p>can enjoy stress-free, well-prepared days on the water.</p>
                    <h2>Discovering Conflict</h2>
                            <p>SplashSync is a responsive web app that simplifies real-time wind, wave, and weather reports for sailors, surfers, and divers. 
                            </p><p>Splashsync addresses the challenges water sports enthusiasts face with interpreting complex wind, wave, and weather data by
                            </p><p>offering an app focused on safety and simplicity. Guided by user personas, the app prioritizes real-time data, customizable dashboards, and
                            </p><p>localized weather insights to meet diverse needs. Through research and iteration, the design focuses on creating clear, intuitive displays and 
                            </p><p>promoting safety habits, enabling users to make informed decisions while out on the water.</p>
            <h2>Competetive Research</h2>
                    <p>To make the app more competitive in the market I had to first see what was out there and how could fill the gaps. I did this by using the SWOT method.</p>
                <h3>Lazy Surfer</h3>
                    <h4>Strengths</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An individualized experience, the user can rate their session, so the preferences are geared towards
                        <br>the specific user rather than a general preference setting </br></li>
                        <li>It has an add friend feature so you can check out their sessions as well</li>
                        <li>Its fairly priced at 49.99/ year </li>
                        <li>The developers are actively taking suggestions from user reviews</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Navigation is a little confusing, once you open drop down navigation bar there are 4 icons</li>
                            <br>at the top but its not clear what they are supposed to be until clicking on them </br>
                        <li>The tips and tricks takes you to a Youtube page instead of just having within the app</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Opportunities</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Better defined navigation menu would set my product apart</li>
                        <li>Having access to purchase or rent surfing gear would also set my app apart.</li>
                        <li>Having safety tips readily available</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Threats</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Because it’s a newer app, apps like Surfline that have been around for awhile
                        <br>they have a wider following and with each new update could potentially surpass Lazy Surfer</br></li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Surfline</h3>
                    <h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Forecasts are solid and are available as soon as you open the app</li>
                    <li>Has a surf shop you can buy surfing gear from which is convenient</li>
                    <li>Has a news feature which could come in handy for surfing outcasts and temperature forecasts</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The homepage is not aesthetically pleasing like other surfing forecast apps that I’ve seen
                    <li>It’s a little pricey compared to other apps offering the same thing (99.99/year)</li>
                    <li>It doesn’t have a social feature like adding a friend or a chats</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Opportunities</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding in a social component like a chat area or and add friend feature </li>
                    <li>Having a more up to date design overall but specially with the homepage </li>
                    <li>Having safety tip readily available</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Threats</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Because the website has been around since 1985, the app is a step in the right direction but
                    <br>staying stuck in older design patterns could be an issue. I noticed this may be the case with</br>
                    <br>the homepage as it seems a little rudimentary in design.</br></li>
                </ul>
            <h2>User Interviews</h2>
             <p>Now that I knew what the app was up against, I wanted to start interviewing users that use similar apps to get a deeper
             <br>understanding of their needs and frustrations. I did this by interviewing six participants and asking them 16 questions through moderated remote testing</br></p>
                <h3>Research Goal</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Have a better understanding of what types of information users tend to prioritize
                             <br>for decision making in their water sport activities </br></li>
                        <li>What are user’s perceptions of the trustworthiness and reliability of weather data
                            <br>that is currently available and how can improve upon that</br></li>
                        <li>Understand how users interpret and apply weather data to plan for their water-based
                            <br> activities and identify any challenges users face in understanding meteorological information.</br></li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The user interviews revealed key insights into the specific weather information crucial for water sports enthusiasts. 
                    <br>For surfers, the focus lies on wave height, wind speed, and swell direction, with wave conditions taking precedence in decision-making.</br>
                <br>Paddleboarders prioritize wind speed for ease of paddling and wave conditions for stability, while boaters prioritize wind speed and direction</br>
                    <br>for navigation safety, with wave conditions playing a secondary role </br>
                <br>All users emphasize the importance of clear visuals and user-friendly interfaces in interpreting weather data. They commonly cross-check forecasts</br>
                     <br>from reliable sources and value historical accuracy for building trust in weather apps, with specialized marine-focused platforms deemed more</br>
                     <br>trustworthy than general weather apps.</br></p>
                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <h2>Ava Reynolds</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age:28</li>
                    <li>Web Chat Interview</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>What kind of water sport do you partake in and what would you say is your experience level?</b></p>
                <p>I like to surf, and I’ve been surfing for about 5 years now</p>
                <p><b>What specific weather information is most important for your water sports activities?</b></p>
                <p>The most critical weather information for my surfing activities includes wave height, wind speed, and swell direction. These factors significantly
                    <br>impact the quality and rideability of the waves, influencing my overall surfing experience.</br></p>
                <p><b>Are there specific sources or providers that you consider more trustworthy than others?</b></p>
                <p>Surf-specific platforms and services dedicated to water sports tend to be more accurate and reliable than general weather apps.</p>
                <p><b>What features or assurances would make you more confident in the accuracy of the weather data provided by a maritime weather app?</b></p>
                <p>Clear explanations of meteorological concepts, real-time updates, and a track record of accurate predictions would significantly boost my confidence in a maritime weather app.</p>
            <h2>User Personas</h2>
            <p>Based on the user interviews I developed user personas, like Alex and Emma, to deeply understand the unique goals and challenges of water sports enthusiasts,
                <br>ensuring the app addresses real user needs such as safety, clarity, and convenience.</br></p>

            <h2>User Flows</h2>
            <p>Using these personas, I mapped user flows to identify key touchpoints, streamlining tasks like checking real-time conditions and navigating user profiles.
                <br>This approach enabled the design of intuitive, visually clear experiences that reduce stress, promote informed decision-making, and make Splashsync an indispensable tool for users.</br></p>
